# Natural Language Processing for Signal Generation on News Data
### Motivation
Stock prices could react significantly to the contents and the presentation of the news release of an impactful story on an industry or company. Hence, news is a great source in the decision-making process of a certain stock's investment. However, the massive amount of news data renders it simply impossible for a human to manually make a systematic approach to trading on news signals. In Finance, every second of the decision-making process matters to result in an effective decision. In our model, we can leverage deep learning in order to train models that provide sentiment scores for headlines, articles, tweets, and posts. These sentiments can produce valuable numerical signals to support a buy/sell/hold decision as well as valuation models.
### Frameworks
* __Data Manipulation__
  * _numpy_: Manipulation for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
  * _pandas_: Manipulation and analysis on numerical tables and time series
* __Machine Learning__
  * _sklearn_: light weight machine learning packaged tools for classification, regression, and clustering algorithms
  * _tensorflow_: Popular deep neural network frameworks.
  * _keras_: high-level API to build and train deep learning models in tensorflow.
* __Natural Language Processing__
  * _nltk_: Natural Language Toolkit
  * _Word Embedings_: files that could be read in to generate the embeding matrix  
* __Utility__
  * _tqdm_: Offers progress bar over iterable (e.g. for loop)
